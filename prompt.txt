I need you to go through all files starting with information about all tables in the sql scripts. Then update informations regarding latitute and longitude. The pickup location(pickup latitude and pickup longitude) of a business should be the latitude and longitude of that business. And given that we only write the address of a business, I need you to use mapbox and the business address to get the corresponding latitude and longitude. Also, when asking for destination address of an order, that address should be converted to latitude and longitude using mapbox. So where every we are adding address and latitude and or longitude are needed, use mapbox to get that information and store deligently in our supabase database
